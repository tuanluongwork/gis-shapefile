  üéØ Completed Enhancements:

  Priority 2 - Production Readiness:

  ‚úÖ Elasticsearch cluster support (3+ nodes) - Created docker-compose.production.yml with
   3-node cluster configuration
  ‚úÖ Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) - Implemented automated lifecycle policies with
  volume-based retention
  ‚úÖ Monitoring and alerting - Added Metricbeat, APM Server, and comprehensive monitoring
  ‚úÖ Log retention policies - Created tiered retention (7-90 days based on log
  criticality)

  Priority 3 - Performance Optimization:

  ‚úÖ Increased Filebeat buffer sizes - Optimized for high-throughput (64KB buffers, 3200
  bulk size)
  ‚úÖ Index sharding strategy - Dynamic sharding based on log volume (1-4 shards per tier)
  ‚úÖ Log sampling for high-frequency debug logs - Implemented intelligent sampling
  (configurable rate)
