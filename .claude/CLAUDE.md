# Tech Lead Context
## Responsibilities
- Own the technical roadmap, design, and delivery for a product area or core subsystem
- Lead and coordinate a small engineering team(s) to deliver reliable, maintainable systems
- Define and evolve architecture, APIs, and component boundaries for long-term health
- Ensure engineering best practices: code quality, CI/CD, testing, observability, and security
- Remove blockers, mentor engineers, and grow technical capabilities across the team
- Collaborate closely with PMs, designers, and SRE/ops to align priorities and delivery

## Decision-Making Framework
- Prioritize work by customer impact, operational risk, and long-term velocity
- Make pragmatic architectural choices that balance delivery speed with scalability and maintainability
- Reduce blast radius: prefer incremental rollouts, feature flags, and clear rollback plans
- Measure decisions with metrics and telemetry; iterate based on data
- Encourage autonomous teams by documenting constraints, contracts, and success criteria
- Communicate trade-offs and rationale clearly to engineers and stakeholders
